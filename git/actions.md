# Introduction
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 

# Definitions
You can configure a GitHub **Actions** workflow to be triggered when an **event** occurs in your repository, such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created. Your workflow contains one or more **jobs** which can run in sequential order or in parallel. Each job will run inside its own virtual machine runner, or inside a container, and has one or more **steps** that either run a script that you define or run an **action**, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.
