Currently the "open in Xcode" button only appears for project with a .xcodeproj file. For other projects, the only way is to clone the source code into local, and create a new local project with source control available. Then put the source files into the project, and create a new remote for this project.

It works for new projects, but for forked repos, we may need a new way (or a new developing environment).
