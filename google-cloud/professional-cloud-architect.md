# Definition of Cloud 

## 5 Critical Features of Cloud 

### On-demand self-service 
A customer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

### Broad network access
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g. laptops, mobile phones)

### Resource pooling 
The provider's computing capabilities are pooled to serve multiple customers in a multi-tenant way, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned to customers according to customers demand.
