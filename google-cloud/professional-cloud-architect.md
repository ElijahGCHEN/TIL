# Definition of Cloud 

## 5 Critical Features of Cloud 

### On-demand self-service 
A customer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

### Broad network access
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g. laptops, mobile phones)

### Resource pooling 
The provider's computing capabilities are pooled to serve multiple customers in a multi-tenant way, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned to customers according to customers demand.

### Rapid elasticity
Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the customer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited.

### Measured service
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). Resources usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency to both the provider and customer of the service utilized.

## Critical Advantages of Cloud

### Agility and flexibility

1. Many of the implementations in cloud would be difficult to impossible to replicate in an on-premise environment without a tremendous amount of work and likely a large capital outlay.
2. The easy availability of, and easy access to, advanced compute, data, and AI services means that companies are better able to innovate and experiment in an environment where the cost of failure can be kept low.

### Cost efficiency
1. The transition from a capital expenditure (CapEx) heavy IT model into an operational expenditure (OpEx) pay-for-what-you-use each-month model eliminates the upfront investment makes for a much more predictable and manageable spend.
2. Unlike an on-prem data center where you would have to provision enough resource in order to meet your highest demand, cloud services and their associated costs can scale back down when the demand drops.
3. It's not saying that you'll always save money by moving your IT services to the cloud. Instead, most organizations will save money if they construct a well-designed cloud-native architecture that considers their demand throughout the design.

### High Availability and Redundancy
1. Google assures availability and redundancy, both within data centers themselves, and by having multiple data centers spread over the globe.

### Global reach
1. Global data centers help reduce client-to-cloud latancy, improving the user experience for a global audience and increasing the ability to comply with regulatory compliances containing regional stipulations.

### Enhanced security
1. The servers Google designs for the data centers, encryption, intrusion detection, security auditting, all allowing GCP to offer levels of security that would be impossible for individual businesses to achieve.
2. Google has taken steps to make sure that you can comply with a vast array of global and industry-specific security standards, helping businesses meet their requirements more efficiently.  

**In essence, Google Cloud offers a blend of economic and operational advantages that enable businesses to thrive in the digital age. Its ability to drive cost-efficiency, foster innovation, meet regulations and provide scalability, all while maintaining high levels of security and reliability, underscores why using Google Cloud is important**

## Cloud architect responsibilities

> An architect's job is to translate the application, together with larger business needs, goals, and requirements, into a cloud infrastructure design that represents the intersection of those needs, all while being secure, available, cost-effective, and scalable.

### Solution design and architecture
Designing the overall cloud solution architecture, including application, data and infrastructure components. This means selecting the proper cloud services, defining
