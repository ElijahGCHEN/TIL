# Definition of Cloud 

## 5 Critical Features of Cloud 

### On-demand self-service 
A customer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

### Broad network access
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g. laptops, mobile phones)

### Resource pooling 
The provider's computing capabilities are pooled to serve multiple customers in a multi-tenant way, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned to customers according to customers demand.

### Rapid elasticity
Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the customer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited.

### Measured service
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). Resources usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency to both the provider and customer of the service utilized.

## Critical Advantages of Cloud

### Agility and flexibility

1. Many of the implementations in cloud would be difficult to impossible to replicate in an on-premise environment without a tremendous amount of work and likely a large capital outlay.
2. The easy availability of, and easy access to, advanced compute, data, and AI services means that companies are better able to innovate and experiment in an environment where the cost of failure can be kept low.

### Cost efficiency
1. The transition from a capital expenditure (CapEx) heavy IT model into an operational expenditure (OpEx) pay-for-what-you-use each-month model eliminates the upfront investment makes for a much more predictable and manageable spend.
2. Unlike an on-prem data center
