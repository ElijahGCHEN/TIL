- **Inline function** is a function that is expanded in line when it is called. When the inline function is called whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of inline function call. 

- When we call `make_shared`, we must specify the type of object we want to create. Like the sequential-container `emplace` members, `make_shared` uses its argumentsto construct an object of the given type. It returns a `shared_ptr` that points to the constructed object. Ordinarily we use `auto` to make it easier to define an object to hold the result of `make_shared`.
