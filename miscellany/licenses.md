1. Proprietary Licenses (Commercial Software):

Characteristics: These are the most restrictive. Users are granted limited rights, typically just to use the software as-is. Modification, redistribution, and often reverse engineering are prohibited. This is the model for most commercial software.   
Warranty: Proprietary licenses may offer a limited warranty, often focused on the media (e.g., the CD-ROM it came on, in older software) being free from defects for a short period. However, warranties on the software itself are often disclaimed or very limited. Many licenses will state "as is" with no implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.   
Liability: Liability is typically limited to the amount paid for the software. Consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, data loss) are almost always disclaimed. The license may specify certain situations where liability is completely excluded. The goal is to minimize the vendor's financial risk.   


2. Open Source Licenses:

Open source licenses grant broad freedoms to users, including the right to use, modify, and distribute the software, often under certain conditions.  There's a wide spectrum of open source licenses, but some common categories include:   

Permissive Licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD):  These are very liberal.  Users can do almost anything with the software as long as they include the original copyright notice and disclaimer in their distributions.   

Copyleft Licenses (e.g., GPLv2, GPLv3, AGPL): These require that if you distribute modified versions of the software, you must also distribute the source code under the same or a compatible copyleft license. This ensures that derivative works also remain open source.   

Warranty (Both Permissive and Copyleft):  Open source licenses almost universally disclaim all warranties.  They are provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  The rationale is that the software is provided by volunteers or communities, and they generally don't have the resources to offer formal warranties.   

Liability (Both Permissive and Copyleft):  Liability is also typically disclaimed or severely limited.  The licenses often state that the authors or distributors are not liable for any damages, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, arising out of the use or inability to use the software.  Again, the goal is to protect the contributors from legal action.   


**MIT License:** The MIT License is a permissive open-source license that allows users to freely use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the software. It requires that the original copyright notice and the license text be included in all copies of the software. It is one of the most permissive licenses and is widely used in open-source projects.

**GNU General Public License (GPL):** The GPL is a copyleft license that ensures the software and any derivative works remain open-source and freely available to the community. If you distribute or modify software under the GPL, you must make the source code available to the recipients and allow them to use it under the same terms.

**Apache License:** The Apache License is a permissive license that allows users to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the software under certain conditions. It is widely used in open-source projects and is often chosen for its balance between permissiveness and protection of patents and trademarks.

**Creative Commons Licenses (CC):** Creative Commons licenses are primarily used for creative works like images, music, videos, and written content. There are several types of CC licenses, ranging from more permissive (CC-BY) to more restrictive (CC-BY-NC-ND), depending on whether commercial use, modifications, and sharing are allowed.

**BSD License:** The BSD License is a permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software, even in proprietary projects. It is similar to the MIT License but may have additional attribution requirements.

**Mozilla Public License (MPL):** The MPL is a copyleft license that permits users to use, modify, and distribute the software under MPL. However, when changes are made to the MPL-licensed code and distributed, those changes must be made available under MPL as well.

**GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL):** The LGPL is similar to the GPL, but it allows linking of the LGPL-licensed software with non-GPL-compatible software without requiring the non-GPL software to be open-source. It is often used for libraries and shared components.

**Affero General Public License (AGPL):** The AGPL is a more stringent version of the GPL, requiring that users who access the software over a network are also entitled to receive the source code. This closes the “ASP loophole” in the GPL.
