1. Proprietary Licenses (Commercial Software):

Characteristics: These are the most restrictive. Users are granted limited rights, typically just to use the software as-is. Modification, redistribution, and often reverse engineering are prohibited. This is the model for most commercial software.   
Warranty: Proprietary licenses may offer a limited warranty, often focused on the media (e.g., the CD-ROM it came on, in older software) being free from defects for a short period. However, warranties on the software itself are often disclaimed or very limited. Many licenses will state "as is" with no implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.   
Liability: Liability is typically limited to the amount paid for the software. Consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, data loss) are almost always disclaimed. The license may specify certain situations where liability is completely excluded. The goal is to minimize the vendor's financial risk.   


2. Open Source Licenses:

Open source licenses grant broad freedoms to users, including the right to use, modify, and distribute the software, often under certain conditions.  There's a wide spectrum of open source licenses, but some common categories include:   

Permissive Licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD):  These are very liberal.  Users can do almost anything with the software as long as they include the original copyright notice and disclaimer in their distributions.   

Copyleft Licenses (e.g., GPLv2, GPLv3, AGPL): These require that if you distribute modified versions of the software, you must also distribute the source code under the same or a compatible copyleft license. This ensures that derivative works also remain open source.   

Warranty (Both Permissive and Copyleft):  Open source licenses almost universally disclaim all warranties.  They are provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  The rationale is that the software is provided by volunteers or communities, and they generally don't have the resources to offer formal warranties.   

Liability (Both Permissive and Copyleft):  Liability is also typically disclaimed or severely limited.  The licenses often state that the authors or distributors are not liable for any damages, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, arising out of the use or inability to use the software.  Again, the goal is to protect the contributors from legal action.
