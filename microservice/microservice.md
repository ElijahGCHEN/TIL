# What is microservice
Microservice is a module in a software that is designed for a specific function.
A software with microservice architecture is designed in a way that each function of the software is built as a microservice, and the functions are connected together by lighweight APIs.
The advantage of this architecture is that
- when the demand for a particular function increases, there's no need to scale the whole software
- when developing the software, each team can take ownership of their only part
